      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The Kievan Rus' marks the foundation of Russian statehood, emerging in 862 when the Varangian prince Rurik established rule in Novgorod, uniting Slavic tribes under a single banner.</p>

    <section id="key-periods">
      <h2>Key Events</h2>
      <p>This period saw the rise of key cities like Kiev, which became the political and cultural center under leaders like Oleg and Vladimir the Great. The adoption of Christianity in 988 by Vladimir I was a pivotal moment, aligning the Rus' with the Byzantine Empire and shaping its religious and cultural identity.</p>
      <p>The Kievan Rus' was a loose federation of principalities, thriving through trade along the Dnieper River and the "Route from the Varangians to the Greeks."</p>

      <h2>Key Historical Periods</h2>
      <p><strong>Founding and Early Expansion (862–912):</strong> The Kievan Rus' began with Rurik's rule in Novgorod in 862, often considered the symbolic founding of the Rus' state. His successor, Oleg, expanded the territory by capturing Kiev in 882, uniting the northern and southern Slavic tribes and establishing Kiev as the capital.</p>
      <p><strong>Height of Power (980–1054):</strong> Under Vladimir the Great (r. 980–1015) and Yaroslav the Wise (r. 1019–1054), the Kievan Rus' reached its zenith. Vladimir's conversion to Christianity in 988 and the subsequent Christianization of the population strengthened ties with the Byzantine Empire. Yaroslav expanded Kiev's influence, codifying laws (Russkaya Pravda) and fostering cultural growth through architecture and literature.</p>
      <p><strong>Fragmentation and Decline (1054–1240):</strong> After Yaroslav's death, the Rus' fragmented into competing principalities. The lack of a strong central authority, coupled with external threats like the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, led to its eventual decline.</p>

    <section id="decline">
      <h2>Decline</h2>
      <p>The decline of Kievan Rus' was a gradual process driven by both internal and external factors. Internally, the death of Yaroslav the Wise in 1054 marked the beginning of fragmentation, as his sons divided the realm into smaller principalities, leading to frequent internecine conflicts over succession and power.</p>
      <p>Externally, the Rus' faced growing threats from neighboring powers. The Cumans, a nomadic group, launched repeated raids, disrupting trade and agriculture. The final blow came with the Mongol invasion starting in 1237, culminating in the sack of Kiev in 1240. The Mongol yoke shifted power to the northeast, where principalities like Moscow and Novgorod eventually rose, marking the end of the Kievan Rus' as a unified entity.</p>
